                <h3>Space</h3>
                <p>Space is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse that exists beyond Earth’s atmosphere. It is a near-perfect vacuum, containing stars, planets, moons, comets, asteroids, and galaxies—all separated by immense distances. Unlike Earth, space has no air to breathe or sound to carry, and temperatures can vary from extreme heat to intense cold. Despite its emptiness, space plays a vital role in shaping the universe, influencing the formation of celestial bodies and the evolution of galaxies over billions of years.</p>

                <h3>Black hole</h3>
                <p>A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape from it. It forms when a massive star collapses under its own gravity at the end of its life cycle. The boundary around a black hole is called the event horizon; once something crosses it, there's no way back. Black holes can grow by pulling in nearby matter and even merging with other black holes. Despite being invisible, they can be detected by observing how they affect nearby stars and gas.</p>

                <h3>Andromeda Galaxy</h3>
                <p>The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and is located about 2.5 million light-years from Earth. It is the largest galaxy in our local group and contains over a trillion stars—more than twice the number in the Milky Way. Visible to the naked eye from dark-sky locations, Andromeda appears as a faint, blurry patch in the night sky. Scientists believe that in about 4 billion years, the Andromeda Galaxy will collide and merge with the Milky Way, forming a new, larger galaxy.</p>
